# Welcome to MatchðŸ¤ Maker!

 With this app you can take a short personality survey and be matched to a new friend who shares your interests.

***

## How to Get Started

1. Open a terminal and navigate into to the MatchMaker root directory. (This is the same folder that contains this README file.)

You will need to install the appropriate node modules to use the app.

2. Inside the terminal, run:

`npm install`

*** 

Now that all of your dependencies have been installed, it's time to start up the server to run the app. 

3. In the terminal, run:

`npm start`

If everything is successful, inside your terminal it will output `server running on port 4500`.

Lastly, open a browser tab or window and navigate to <http://localhost:4500>

You will see the MatchMaker home page. Click the orange button to begin the survey!

Follow the directions to be matched with a new friend! Have fun!
